# IsharahNow - AI-Driven Sign Language Interpretation System

In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence and computer vision have paved the way for transformative solutions across diverse fields. As society embraces inclusivity and strives for accessible communication, the need for technology that bridges linguistic gaps has never been more critical. IsharahNow, our sign language interpretation system, addresses this need by utilizing state-of-the-art AI, speech recognition, and computer vision techniques. This innovative system translates spoken language into visual sign language, making communication smoother and more accessible for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community, thus promoting inclusivity and enhancing social interaction.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## üìÅ Project Structure
- `app/` - Defines the structure and layout of all pages and core routes
- `components/` - Contains all reusable UI components used across pages
- `hooks/` - Provides custom React hooks to fetch and manage data
- `lib/` - Houses utility/helper functions shared across the project
- `providers/` - Manages application context, mainly video call streaming
- `constants/` - Stores application-wide constants like meeting types
- `public/` - Contains icons, images, and static assets served by the frontend

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muneefrehman/IsharahNow.git
cd IsharahNow
```

### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in frontend with keys such as:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your_publishable_key>
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up

NEXT_PUBLIC_STREAM_API_KEY=<your_stream_api_key>
STREAM_SECRET_KEY=<your_stream_secret_key>

NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=localhost:3000

NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_aws_access_key_id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_aws_secret_access_key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION=<your_aws_region>
```

### 4. Run Frontend Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Test Connectivity

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to verify the frontend is working and connected to backend APIs.
